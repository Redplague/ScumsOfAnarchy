STREAMSNIPING/METAGAMING
- Stream Sniping is when you use a players stream in-game to see their location etc and to attack them. 
This is NOT PERMITTED in any way shape or form and a streamer can use certain tools to see who is watching - we want to encourage streamers to promote the server.
- Metagaming is where you watch a stream or video and use it to divulge information on something you would know have known had you not watched it to your advantage. 
You must only find things out through in-game and RP. For example, Streamer X showed his Gang raiding a base or pick locking an area. You CANNOT use the information from the stream to then pass this on and say it was them who did it. 
Other examples include base locations, stash locations, vehicles, any views or information said on Stream/Video.

MULTIPLE CHARACTERS
- You cannot use multiple steam accounts to run multiple characters on this server, we permit only 1 character per player.
Any player found to be using mutliple characters to min/max their skillsets will be banned as per the exploit punishment tier. 

YOU MAY NOT USE ANY TYPE OF EXPLOIT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE IN-GAME! 
INCLUDES BUT NOT LIMITED TO BASE RAIDING, LOCKPICKING, ITEM DUPLICATION ETC. 18/08/2019
