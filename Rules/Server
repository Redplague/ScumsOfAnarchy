20.   Streamsniping/Metagaming
20.a  Stream Sniping is when you use a players stream in-game to see their location etc and to attack them. 
This is NOT PERMITTED in any way shape or form and a streamer can use certain tools to see who is watching - we want to encourage streamers to promote the server.
20.b  Metagaming is where you watch a stream or video and use it to divulge information on something you would know have known had you not watched it to your advantage. 
You must only find things out through in-game and RP. For example, Streamer X showed his Gang raiding a base or pick locking an area. You CANNOT use the information from the stream to then pass this on and say it was them who did it. 
Other examples include base locations, stash locations, vehicles, any views or information said on Stream/Video.

21.   Multiple Characters
21.a  You cannot use multiple steam accounts to run multiple characters on this server, we permit only 1 character per player.
Any player found to be using mutliple characters to min/max their skillsets will be punished as per the exploit punishment tier. 

22.   Exploits
22.a  You may not use any type of known exploit ingame, anyone found using an exploit for their own advantage will be punished as per the punishment tier. 
      This includes but is not limited to
      - Base Raiding
      - Lock Picking
      - Item Duplication 
      - Fame Farming
25.   Car Hoarding
25.a  Car hoarding is not permitted, any gang/group/base found to be holding more than 5 vehicles will have the location announced on Discord. Admins will carry out periodic audits to ensure players are complying.
25.b  Excess cars can either be traded to other players/gangs or destroyed.
